WELCOME TO TOWER POWER!

The objective of this game is to reach a five star rating for your tower.

You are the proud owner of a no-star tower that consists merely of an empty floor with no units. However you have just received a small inheritance of $1000 from your long-lost, twice-removed, late cousin's granny all the way from Timbuktu. This small fortune happens to be just enough to start your tower empire! You have to find a way for your tower to reach 5 stars before you run out of money or you will lose the game. Build as fast as possible for a better score!

Each floor of your tower supports 6 spaces to add units.

🏠 Residential Units increase population by 5 people and cost $100 to build. Be careful though! Each residential unit also costs money to maintain and will deduct $9 every second.

💰 Commercial Units generate $6 in revenue per second and cost $150 to build. Unlike residential units, commercial units do not have a maintenance fee.


🌟 Gain Stars 🌟 by increasing your tower population.
